# TUS in swipl

TUS protocol for resumable file uploads via HTTP in swipl (see:
https://tus.io/)

This package implements both the server handlers and a simple client.

## Examples

## TODO

We have not implemented any of the optional parts of the protocol save

We also have not implemented respect for the `X-HTTP-Method-Override`
header which is a TUS requirement.
